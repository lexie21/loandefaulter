## Introduction

<b>What this project is about?</b>
<details>
<summary>
Project Scope

</summary>
 Loan default prediction is critical for financial institutions to minimize risk and make informed lending decisions. This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect potential loan defaulters based on historical borrower data. 

The objective is to analyze key borrower attributes—such as income, credit history, loan amount, and repayment behavior—to identify patterns that indicate a higher risk of default.

 By accurately predicting defaulters, this project aims to help financial institutions improve risk assessment, reduce losses, and optimize lending strategies. These insights can also enhance customer profiling and responsible lending practices.

EDA
  
</summary>

- Analyzed default rates across different dimensions (e.g., borrower demographics, loan type) to identify key risk factors.
- Examined default trends over time to detect seasonality or economic influences.
